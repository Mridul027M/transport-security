It is a web application that tracks user's current location and as soon as the user
approaches any criminal area, he/she will be notified with the data of the crime in
that area.
The frontend of the application is coded with the help of react.js, html,css and
javascript. And backend is coded with node.js and express.js. I have used mongoDb
as database for this project.
